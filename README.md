This repository contains the code for our paper [Minimum Description Length and Generalization Guarantees for Representation Learning](), which has been accepted by NeurIPS 2023.

## Installation

Most of the requirements are standard Python packages and the CUDA toolkit. A full list of packages can be found below. 

### Requirements:
- Python >= 3.10
- PyTorch >= 1.12.0 (+ CUDA 11.0)
- torchvision >= 0.14 (+ CUDA 11.0)
- matplotlib
- time
- os
- numpy
- numbers

## Reproduction of the results

To reproduce the results reported in our paper, run firstly the script ['main.py']. The full training time may take several hours, but it could be shortened by reducing the number of repetitions (line 13) from 5 to 1. The training results and the trained models are stored in the directory ['results'], in a folder with a most recent timestamp. 

The training results could be visualized using the script ['analyze_results.py']. In line 5 of the script, it is necessary to select a timestamp pointing to the folder with the results. The produced graphs will be saved in the directory ['figures'], in a folder with a corresponding timestamp.
